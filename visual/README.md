# AIST Visual Assets

Infographics and lifecycle posters explaining the AIST protocol. Use them in articles, talks, social posts, or README files.

All visual assets are self-contained HTML files — no external dependencies. Open in any browser, take a screenshot, or embed directly.

## Assets

| File | Style | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| `aist-infographic.html` | Mid-century PSA poster (cream/rust/teal) | Article hero images, social shares |
| `aist-infographic-vault.html` | Vault-Tec CRT panels (blue steel, scanlines) | Dark-mode contexts, GitHub README |
| `aist-lifecycle-svg.html` | Green phosphor terminal with SVG stick figures | Technical blogs, dev communities |
| `aist-lifecycle-iconic.html` | Bold cream propaganda poster | Quick screenshots, social media replies |

## Core Metaphor

All visuals use the **plant-on-monitor** metaphor:

- **With AIST:** Plant grows across sessions — seedling to tree. Project thrives.
- **Without AIST:** Plant dies — seedling to dead stump with skull. Project dies after ~3 sessions.

The plant represents the project, not the user. The character's state mirrors the plant's — energized vs exhausted.

## AI Image Generation

`imagegen-spec.md` contains prompts at three detail levels (full spec / condensed / one-liner) for generating additional visual assets with AI image generation tools. Tested with Nano Banana Pro — produced excellent retro-futuristic dual-pathway posters.
