# AIST Protocol — Project Lifecycle Infographic
## Image Generation Spec for AI Art Tools

---

## CONCEPT
A retro-futuristic dual-pathway infographic poster in the style of Vault-Tec safety manuals and mid-century atomic age public service announcements. NOT literally Fallout branded — no Vault-Tec logos, Pip-Boy characters, or copyrighted elements. Instead: original retro-futuristic art deco styling with 1950s optimism meets nuclear age anxiety.

**Format**: Landscape, roughly 16:9 or 3:2 ratio
**Style**: Retro-futuristic propaganda poster. Flat illustration with limited color palette. Think WPA posters meet atomic age safety manuals meet science classroom wall charts. Visible grain/texture like aged print.

## OVERALL LAYOUT

The poster is split into two vertical halves, side by side:

## COLOR PALETTE

- **Background**: Deep navy blue (#1a2e4a) or dark teal (#0d2a2a) — like a vintage chalkboard or blueprint
- **Left pathway**: Teal/green tones — health, growth, life
- **Right pathway**: Amber → red tones — decay, danger, death
- **Accents**: Cream/off-white for text, gold/amber for highlights
- **Panel borders**: Art deco style gold or brass lines, rounded corners

---

## CHARACTER DESIGN

A stylized retro-futuristic person (gender-neutral, simple, iconic — like a safety manual illustration). NOT a Pip-Boy. Think: 1950s educational poster figure with slightly exaggerated proportions. Wearing a simple jumpsuit or lab coat. Visible from roughly waist up, sitting at a retro-futuristic computer terminal with a curved CRT monitor.

The SAME character appears in both pathways, starting identical, then diverging.

---

## PATHWAY A: "SUSTAINED OPERATIONS" (Left Side)

### Stage 1: INITIALIZATION (Session 01)
- Character sitting upright at terminal, alert and optimistic
- Monitor shows a small **seedling/sprout** growing from digital soil
- Screen has a soft green glow
- Clean, organized workspace
- Mood: fresh start, possibility
- Small label: "FULL CONTEXT · 100% AVAILABLE"

### Stage 2: ACTIVE GROWTH (Session 02)  
- Character leaning forward, engaged, slight smile
- Monitor shows **a growing plant with multiple leaves**, taller than before
- Small glowing badge on screen corner reads "AIST" 
- A small translucent bar on the side of the monitor shows ~12% used (green), 88% free
- Mood: confident, productive
- Label: "AIST LOADED · 950 TOKENS · 88% FREE"

### Stage 3: FULL BLOOM (Session 10+)
- Character leaning back comfortably, feet possibly on desk edge, arms behind head
- Monitor shows a **flourishing plant with flowers blooming**, lush and vibrant
- Same small AIST badge still glowing
- Same bar still showing 12% used — hasn't changed
- Coffee cup on desk (relaxed)
- Mood: thriving, in flow
- Label: "STILL 950 TOKENS · STILL 88% FREE"

### Stage 4: ETERNAL BLOOM (Session 50+)
- Character standing triumphantly or giving a thumbs-up, beaming
- Monitor shows a **magnificent tree bearing golden fruit**, radiating light
- Small sparkles or stars around the tree
- Same 12% bar — emphasize it hasn't moved
- Mood: celebration, permanence
- Label: "∞ SESSIONS · ANY LLM · PROJECT LIVES FOREVER"

**Visual flow**: Green/teal arrows flowing downward between stages. Each stage in its own rounded panel like a botanical illustration plate.

---

## PATHWAY B: "SYSTEMIC DECAY" (Right Side)

### Stage 1: INITIALIZATION (Session 01)
- IDENTICAL to Pathway A Stage 1 — same character, same sprout, same hope
- This is critical: they start the SAME
- Label: "FULL CONTEXT · 100% AVAILABLE"

### Stage 2: CONTEXT PRESSURE (Session 02)
- Character squinting at screen, hand scratching head, slightly confused
- Monitor shows the **plant with leaves starting to droop slightly**
- Screen is partially filled with lines of text (recap) — amber colored, encroaching on the plant
- Bar shows 35% used (amber), 65% free
- Mood: first signs of trouble
- Label: "RECAP: ~2,800 TOKENS · 65% FREE"

### Stage 3: CONTEXT STARVATION (Session 03-04)
- Character with hands on head, stressed, leaning forward in distress
- Monitor shows **a wilting, browning plant** being crowded out by walls of text
- Screen is now ~70% filled with amber/red text lines, plant barely visible
- Bar shows 70% used (orange-red), 30% free
- Stress lines or sweat drops near character's head
- Mood: desperation, losing control
- Label: "RECAP: ~5,700 TOKENS · 30% FREE"

### Stage 4: TERMINAL FAILURE (Session 05)
- Character slumped over the terminal, face on desk, defeated
- Monitor shows a **skull and crossbones** where the plant used to be
- Screen is completely filled with red — no space left
- The dead stump of the plant is barely visible behind the skull
- Bar shows 100% used (dark red), 0% free
- Maybe the monitor is cracked or flickering
- Mood: death, abandonment, game over
- Label: "CONTEXT EXHAUSTED · 0% FREE · PROJECT DEAD"

**Visual flow**: Red arrows flowing downward between stages, getting more jagged/broken. Each stage panel increasingly cracked or damaged.

---

## BOTTOM BANNER

Full-width strip across the bottom with two outcome boxes:

**Left (green/teal background)**:
- Large infinity symbol (∞)
- "ETERNAL BLOOM"
- "Same 950 tokens · Every session · Any LLM"

**Right (dark red background)**:
- Large skull symbol (☠)  
- "TERMINAL FAILURE"
- "~3-5 sessions on 8K · Then nothing"

**Tagline across the very bottom**:
"Recaps grow. Handoffs don't. That's the difference between a project that dies and one that lives."

**Footer text** (small):
"AIST Protocol v0.5 · Open Source · CC BY-SA 4.0 · Plain Text · Any LLM · No Vendor Lock-in"

## IMPORTANT STYLE NOTES

1. **NOT Fallout branded** — no Vault-Boy, no Vault-Tec logo, no thumbs-up mascot. Original retro-futuristic character design.
2. The **plant metaphor IS the project** — it grows or dies based on how context is managed.
3. **Both pathways start IDENTICAL** — same character, same plant, same optimism. The divergence is the whole point.
4. The **context meter bar** should be visible in every stage — it's the visual proof.
5. **Text lines on screen** in Pathway B represent the growing recap that's eating the workspace.
6. Art deco borders, panel dividers, decorative corner elements. Blueprint/schematic feel.
7. **Aged/textured** — slight grain, slightly faded like a poster that's been on a wall for years.
8. Keep it **fun but not unserious** — this is informational propaganda, not a joke. The humor comes from the style, not the content.

## ALTERNATE PROMPT (condensed, for character-limited tools)

"Retro-futuristic dual-pathway infographic poster, 1950s atomic age safety manual style. Dark navy background with art deco gold borders. Left side 'SUSTAINED OPERATIONS' in teal/green: 4 stages showing a person at a retro computer terminal, each stage shows a plant growing bigger on the monitor screen, from seedling to magnificent fruit-bearing tree, person increasingly relaxed and happy. Right side 'SYSTEMIC DECAY' in amber/red: same 4 stages but plant wilts and dies, screen fills with text walls, person goes from optimistic to stressed to slumped over desk, final screen shows skull and crossbones. Both sides start identical. Context meter bars on each stage. Bottom banner: infinity symbol vs skull. Tagline: 'Recaps grow. Handoffs don't.' Aged paper texture, retro grain. NOT Fallout/Vault-Tec branded."

## EVEN SHORTER PROMPT

"1950s retro science poster, two pathways side by side on dark blue background. Left: person at retro computer, plant on screen grows from seedling to tree across 4 stages, green tones, person happy. Right: same start but plant wilts and dies across 4 stages, screen fills with text, red tones, person collapses. Art deco borders, aged texture, propaganda poster feel. Bottom: infinity vs skull."
