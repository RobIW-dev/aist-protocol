# Contributing to AIST

AIST was built for one developer's workflow. The most valuable contributions come from people adapting it for theirs.

## How to Contribute

### Share Your Adaptation

The highest-value contribution is a description of how you adapted AIST:

- What sections did you add?
- What did you remove or change?
- What problems did you solve that v0.5 doesn't address?
- What models or workflows did you test it on?

Open an issue with the label `adaptation` and describe what you did. These real-world reports shape future versions more than any feature request.

### Report a Problem

If something in the spec is ambiguous, contradictory, or doesn't work as documented — open an issue. Concrete examples are more useful than general feedback.

### Suggest a Section

If you're capturing a type of knowledge that doesn't fit any existing section, describe it with an example of what it would look like in practice. The bar for new sections is high (each one adds token cost to every handoff), but good ideas expand the protocol.

### Fix Documentation

Typos, unclear explanations, broken links — PRs welcome. No issue required.

## What We're Not Looking For (Yet)

- **Tooling.** The spec is the product right now. Tools come after adoption.
- **Breaking changes.** v0.5 is backward-compatible with v0.4. That matters.
- **Governance structures.** It's too early. If a community forms, we'll figure it out then.

## Style

- Plain text over rich formatting
- Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Short over long
- "Here's what happened when I tried it" over "Here's what I think should change"
