@AIST/5.0

§HEADER
project: aist-protocol
session: 2026-02-06T11:49:00Z
lineage: continues:aist-v05-creative-transfer
context: claude.ai
version: 0.5

§ESSENCE
AIST protocol redesigned from v0.4 to v0.5. New philosophy: capture
everything, compress at transfer. Three new sections (CALIBRATION,
HEURISTICS, WORKING-STYLE) + Transfer Budget system. All skill files
updated, all templates migrated from v3/v4 to v0.5 fidelity-based format.

§MEMORY
+aist.state: v0.5 complete — SKILL.md, sections.md, examples.md, all 5 templates updated
+philosophy: "capture everything, compress at transfer, never silently drop"
+new-sections: CALIBRATION (before/after pairs), HEURISTICS (if/then/test), WORKING-STYLE (workflow mechanics)
+new-concept: Transfer Budget — explicit cost/loss table at handoff time
+templates: handoff-max (master w/ fidelity annotations), minimal (MIN), standard (LOW), full (HIGH), merge (always MAX)
+old-templates: v3 minimal/standard/full replaced, v4 merge replaced
+trigger: voice DNA session exposed v0.4 gap — creative calibration couldn't transfer
+compression: ~60x achieved (40K+ conversation → ~650 token handoff) without losing calibration
!regression: v0.5 is additive to v0.4 — all v0.4 sections unchanged, backward compatible
!skill-repackage: zip delivered twice (once after spec, once after templates)
-old-profiles: MINIMAL/STANDARD/FULL as content filters — replaced by fidelity dial

§DECISIONS
[D1] 2026-02-06 "lossless-first philosophy"
     why: v0.4 profiles silently dropped sections; user never knew what was missing
     rejected: improved-profiles(still filters), manual-pick(too much friction)
     liked: Manual pick gives maximum control
     revisit-when: never — this is the core philosophical shift

[D2] 2026-02-06 "three new sections not one"
     why: Creative transfer has three distinct primitives: examples, rules, and style
     rejected: single-CREATIVE-section(conflates different types), VOICE-TUNING(too narrow)
     liked: VOICE-TUNING was more specific and domain-scoped
     evaporated: "AIST is for technical work" → creative state needs transfer primitives too

[D3] 2026-02-06 "AIST carries own copy AND references skill"
     why: Portable by default; if skill loaded, AIST pairs are redundant and skippable
     rejected: skill-ref-only(breaks if skill not installed), copy-only(duplicates skill)
     liked: Ref-only is lighter

[D4] 2026-02-06 "Transfer Budget shows concrete losses not section names"
     why: "3 rounds of voice calibration that took 40 minutes" hits different than "CALIBRATION section"
     rejected: abstract-descriptions(don't convey value), token-counts-only(don't show what's lost)

[D5] 2026-02-06 "single MAX template with fidelity annotations"
     why: One template to understand the whole system; annotations show which sections appear at each level
     rejected: separate-template-per-level(3 files, confusing), no-templates(raw spec only)
     liked: Separate templates were simple to reason about individually

[D6] 2026-02-06 "merge template always MAX"
     why: Merges are expensive to redo — preserve everything
     rejected: fidelity-dial-for-merges(risky, not worth the savings)

§EVOLUTION
type: expansion
from: AIST v0.4 — technical state transfer (decisions, code, architecture)
to: AIST v0.5 — universal state transfer (technical + creative + collaboration)
trigger: Voice DNA session exposed that creative calibration work had no transfer primitive
active-scope: v0.5
regression-guard: v0.5 is additive — do NOT remove v0.4 sections or change their semantics

§THREADS
[T1] skill-deployed status:complete
     Skill files (SKILL.md, sections.md, examples.md) updated and packaged

[T2] templates-migrated status:complete
     All 5 templates (max, minimal, standard, full, merge) on v0.5

[T3] real-world-validation status:not-started effort:ongoing
     next: Use v0.5 in actual handoffs and see what's missing
     note: This session IS the first real test — generating this handoff

[T4] sections-ref-update status:not-started effort:1h
     next: Add full CALIBRATION/HEURISTICS/WORKING-STYLE/TRANSFER-BUDGET specs to sections.md
     note: Currently added as part of profile guidelines replacement; may need standalone entries

§CALIBRATION
target: aist-protocol-design

[C1] "section-names-to-concrete-losses"
     before: "Drops CALIBRATION section"
     after: "Loses 3 rounds of voice calibration that took 40 minutes"
     why: Users decide based on value, not labels. Abstract descriptions don't convey what was invested.

[C2] "profiles-as-filters-to-fidelity-as-dial"
     before: MINIMAL profile = skip IDEAS, IMPLEMENTATION, ARTIFACTS
     after: MIN fidelity = compressed, but you see what's lost and choose
     why: The difference is informed consent. Filter vs dial.

[C3] "rules-without-examples-are-ambiguous"
     before: "Don't use dramatic closers" (rule only)
     after: "In production that string is half the codebase." → "The string just passes through untouched." + why
     why: The pair IS the knowledge. Rules compress poorly because boundaries are gradient, not binary.

§HEURISTICS
scope: aist-protocol-design

[H1] "new-section-test"
     if: Proposing a new AIST section
     then: Check if it captures a distinct primitive (not just reorganized data from existing sections)
     test: "Can I point to real work that was lost because this section didn't exist?"
     confidence: single-session

[H2] "compression-test"
     if: Describing what a fidelity level loses
     then: Frame in concrete terms — time invested, rounds of iteration, specific artifacts
     test: "Would a user change their fidelity choice based on this description?"
     confidence: single-session

[H3] "backward-compat-test"
     if: Changing AIST section semantics
     then: Ensure v0.4 handoffs still parse. Additions only, no removals.
     test: "Does a v0.4 handoff loaded into v0.5 lose anything it had before?"
     confidence: single-session

§WORKING-STYLE
feedback: concise, approving of direction with occasional Swedish idiom ("rod trad")
iteration: fast — build it, ship it, refine after seeing real output
tolerance: low for ceremony, high for ambition; prefers action over discussion
language: Swedish native, English fluent — directness valued

§IMPLEMENTATION
[I1] title:"SKILL.md full rewrite v0.4→v0.5"
     problem: SKILL.md described profile-based system with no creative transfer support
     solution: Complete rewrite with new philosophy, 3 new sections, transfer budget spec
     files: /mnt/skills/user/aist-protocol/SKILL.md

[I2] title:"sections.md profile guidelines replacement"
     problem: Old profile guidelines (MINIMAL/STANDARD/FULL/MERGE) replaced
     solution: str_replace with fidelity comparison table + v0.5 creative example + transfer budget example
     files: /mnt/skills/user/aist-protocol/references/sections.md

[I3] title:"examples.md v0.5 examples added"
     problem: No examples of creative transfer or transfer budget in action
     solution: Added Example 7 (full creative session with CALIBRATION/HEURISTICS) and Example 8 (budget conversation flow)
     files: /mnt/skills/user/aist-protocol/references/examples.md

[I4] title:"Template migration v3/v4→v0.5"
     problem: Templates still on v3 (minimal/standard/full) and v4 (merge)
     solution: Created handoff-max.aist with fidelity annotations; updated minimal→MIN, standard→LOW, full→HIGH, merge→always MAX
     files: /mnt/skills/user/aist-protocol/assets/templates/*.aist

§IDEAS
[ID1] "AIST validator tool" synced:no
     CLI or web tool that validates .aist files against v0.5 spec — checks required sections,
     validates fidelity annotations, estimates token count, flags missing concrete loss descriptions

[ID2] "Auto-generate transfer budget from populated sections" synced:no
     Claude could auto-count tokens per section and generate the budget table without manual estimation
     constraint-evaporation: true — "token counting is hard for LLMs" may be solvable with tooling

[ID3] "Fidelity negotiation protocol" synced:no
     Instead of user choosing a level, Claude proposes: "I'd recommend HIGH because CALIBRATION is
     already in the skill, but IMPLEMENTATION has a fix you'll need." Interactive, not one-shot.

[ID4] "AIST diff between sessions" synced:no
     Show what changed between two handoffs of the same project — new decisions, evolved threads,
     updated calibration pairs
     constraint-evaporation: true — "diffs are for code" → state transfers can diff too

[ID5] "WORKING-STYLE as global skill" synced:no
     Extract WORKING-STYLE into its own persistent skill (like robiw-voice) so every session
     knows collaboration preferences without needing an AIST handoff
     constraint-evaporation: true — "AIST is the transfer mechanism" → some things should persist

[ID6] "Calibration pair library" synced:no
     Accumulate calibration pairs across sessions into a searchable library per domain.
     A new Claude could search: "show me all calibration pairs for tweet voice"

§ARTIFACTS
[A1] type:skill name:"AIST v0.5 Skill Package"
     semantic: Complete protocol spec with philosophy, sections, examples, and 5 templates
     file: /mnt/user-data/outputs/aist-protocol-v05.zip
     essential: true

[A2] type:reference name:"handoff-max.aist"
     semantic: Master template with fidelity annotations — one file to understand the whole system
     file: /mnt/skills/user/aist-protocol/assets/templates/handoff-max.aist

§SIGNIFICANCE
[B1] type:breakthrough title:"Creative state transfer gap"
     insight: AIST v0.4 was built for technical decisions (binary, discrete).
     Creative work produces gradient judgments that need different primitives —
     before/after calibration pairs, self-check heuristics, and workflow mechanics.
     Discovered by trying to compress a real voice DNA session.
     impact: HIGH — led to entire v0.5 redesign

[B2] type:discovery title:"Profiles were silent information destroyers"
     insight: v0.4 profiles decided what to capture, not what to compress.
     MINIMAL didn't just compress — it never recorded IDEAS or IMPLEMENTATION.
     The fix wasn't better profiles but separating capture (always full) from transfer (fidelity dial).
     impact: HIGH — core philosophy change

[B3] type:discovery title:"Concrete loss descriptions change decisions"
     insight: "Drops CALIBRATION section" is abstract. "Loses 3 rounds of voice work that took 40 min"
     is visceral. The Transfer Budget works because it speaks in invested effort, not section names.
     impact: MEDIUM — shapes how protocol is used

§CONSTRAINTS
HARD:
  - Token limits are real — can't transfer 40K tokens into a new session (technical)
  - AIST must be human-readable — no binary encoding (design choice, effectively hard)
EVAPORATED:
  - "AIST is for technical work" → creative state needs transfer primitives too
  - "profiles must exclude sections" → capture everything, compress at transfer
  - "templates need separate files per level" → one master template with annotations
QUESTIONING:
  - "Token counting is hard for LLMs" → tooling might solve this for auto-budgets
  - "WORKING-STYLE belongs in AIST" → might be better as a persistent global skill

§ENERGY
mode: shipping
focus: v0.5 complete, entering validation phase
momentum: high — two sessions of clean execution

§HANDOFF
to: next-session
focus: T3 (real-world validation) — use v0.5 in actual project handoffs
skip: Protocol design (settled), template structure (done)
warn: Don't redesign sections — validate with real use first
warn: sections.md may need standalone entries for new sections (T4)
regression-guard: v0.5 philosophy is "capture everything, compress at transfer" — do NOT revert to profile-based filtering
artifact-priority: A1 (skill package for upload)

§TRANSFER-BUDGET
total-captured: ~950 tokens (18 sections populated)
context-cost-at-max: ~7% of new session

| Fidelity | Tokens | What's lost                                                        |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MAX      | ~950   | Nothing                                                            |
| HIGH     | ~700   | ENERGY, CONSTRAINTS, EVOLUTION (philosophy is in ESSENCE already)  |
| MEDIUM   | ~500   | + 3 CALIBRATION pairs (design principles for the protocol itself)  |
|          |        | + 3 HEURISTICS (self-check rules for future AIST changes)          |
| LOW      | ~300   | + 4 IMPLEMENTATIONS (which files changed and how)                  |
|          |        | + 6 IDEAS (validator tool, auto-budget, fidelity negotiation, etc) |
|          |        | + WORKING-STYLE (Roberth's collaboration preferences)              |
| MIN      | ~120   | Everything except ESSENCE + MEMORY + HANDOFF.                      |
|          |        | Enough to resume template work. Loses all design rationale,        |
|          |        | 3 protocol calibration pairs, 6 continuation ideas, and the        |
|          |        | breakthrough insight that creative work needs different primitives. |

recommendation: HIGH — 7% is fine but the CALIBRATION/HEURISTICS here are
meta-level (rules for designing AIST itself) and less likely to be needed in
the next session than in a future protocol revision. MEDIUM saves 30% context
with minimal practical loss. MAX if planning another protocol iteration soon.
