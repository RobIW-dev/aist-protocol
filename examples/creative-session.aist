+warm-up: 24-48h restriction, browsing/following, no forced tweets
!pending: username change to @RobIW (rate limited, retry in 1-2h)
!pending: first tweet is #20 (transparency) when restrictions lift

§DECISIONS
[D1] 2026-02-06 "Professional account as Creator not Business"
     why: Individual maker positioning, not company
     rejected: Business (implies team/company)

[D2] 2026-02-06 "Scanner error as launch header"
     why: Authentic builder energy, conversation starter
     rejected: Exocortex screenshot (save for later when established)
     revisit-when: After first week of posting

[D3] 2026-02-06 "Lead with transparency tweet"
     why: Sets account identity from day one — AI-honest practitioner

§CALIBRATION
target: robiw-voice-dna

[C1] "staged-to-natural"
     before: "Tested GitHub Copilot on a production stored procedure..."
     after: "ChatGPT rewrote a query and made it significantly slower. Missed the obvious index."
     why: Real practitioners notice things while working. They don't sit down to test tools for tweets.

[C2] "remove-dramatic-closers"
     before: "...In production that string is half the codebase."
     after: "...The string just passes through untouched."
     why: If the observation is done, stop. No stump lines for effect.

[C3] "remove-sweeping-claims"
     before: "Every AI SQL tool stumbles on them."
     after: "No tooling validates them across GO batches."
     why: "Every tool" is easy to pick apart. Name what happened specifically.

[C4] "non-native-phrasing"
     before: "Completely different skill."
     after: "Entirely different job."
     why: Shorter, more direct. How a Swedish engineer writes in English.

§HEURISTICS
scope: robiw-voice

[H1] if: Tweet describes testing/evaluating a tool
     then: Rewrite as something noticed while working
     test: "Would someone tweet this in the moment?"

[H2] if: Tweet ends with dramatic one-liner designed to land
     then: Cut it. End where the observation ends.
     test: "Remove last sentence. Is the tweet worse?"

[H3] if: "Every tool" / "all X" / "no Y does Z"
     then: Name the specific tool and what happened
     test: "Could someone reply with a counterexample?"

[H4] if: Phrasing sounds too literary
     then: Shorter sentence. More direct.
     test: "Would I type this in Slack?"

§WORKING-STYLE
feedback: concise, points to specific words, gives their real version
iteration: fast — fix and show, don't ask permission
tolerance: low for filler/drama, high for imperfection
language: English 2nd/3rd — affects what "natural" means

§THREADS
[T1] username-change status:blocked
     next: Retry @RobIW after rate limit clears (1-2h)

[T2] account-warmup status:in-progress
     next: Browse, follow 15-20, like posts for 24-48h

[T3] first-tweet status:ready
     next: Post Tweet 20 (transparency) when restrictions lift

§ARTIFACTS
[A1] type:skill name:"robiw-voice v2"
     semantic: X persona with 3 anti-patterns from calibration rounds
     file: /mnt/skills/user/robiw-voice/

[A2] type:content name:"Tweet Batch v3"
     semantic: 20 tweets, voice-calibrated, 7-day schedule
     file: robiw-tweet-batch-1-v3.md

§TRANSFER-BUDGET
total-captured: ~650 tokens
context-cost-at-max: ~0.3% of 200K window

| Fidelity | Tokens | What's lost                                           |
|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| MAX      | ~650   | Nothing                                               |
| HIGH     | ~500   | WORKING-STYLE, ARTIFACTS                              |
| MEDIUM   | ~350   | + CALIBRATION pairs (refs to skill only)              |
|          |        | + HEURISTICS (refs to skill only)                     |
| LOW      | ~200   | + DECISIONS, THREADS                                  |
| MIN      | ~100   | Everything except ESSENCE + MEMORY + HANDOFF          |

recommendation: MAX — 0.3% context cost. The calibration pairs took 3 rounds
of real refinement and are the most valuable content to preserve.
